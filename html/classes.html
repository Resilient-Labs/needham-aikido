				<h4>Classes</h4>
				<p>At Needham / Newton Aikido, classes are structured to be appropriate for adults and teens of all levels, with the intensity of training varying according to ability and stamina. Beginners are welcome and no previous martial arts experience is necessary.
				<br>
				<br>
				Please see the Class Schedule.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="feature give-padding">
				<h4>Children</h4>
				<p>There are currently no designated children's classes at the club. Subject to individual application and interview, arrangements can sometimes be made for parents who are already members and would like to bring a child to train with them.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="feature give-padding">
				<h4>Attire</h4>
				<p>Visitors should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing with no belts, buckles, or jewelry/watches to class. Club members practice in a simple white martial arts uniform with a white belt; these can be purchased through the club, or students can feel free to purchase their own from an online vendor of their choice.</p>

					<h2>Warm Up and Conditioning</h2>
					<p>Warming up prior to class by stretching and performing simple calisthenics and other conditioning exercises helps to prevent injury and prepare the body for more rigorous practice. Further more specific conditioning exercises develop the skills necessary to execute Aikido throws and to fall safely. At the club we place a particular emphasis on conditioning our bodies in order to be ready for practice.</p>

					<h2>Body Art</h2>
					<p>"Body Art" is just simply practicing throwing each other and falling. The teacher will demonstrate one technique while the class observes, then everyone will practice the technique with a partner. Working with a partner during the Aikido class will help to develop a natural feel for performing a technique well.
					<br>
					<br>
					Discussion is kept to a minimum to preserve an energized and attentive practice environment. Partnered practice is vigorous but not competitive, and the intensity-level is based on the skill of the participants.</p>

					<h2>Traditional Weapons</h2>
					<p>Many Aikido movements are derived from those used in the practice of traditional Japanese weapons. When space or weather permit, the club may practice with the Jo (a Japanese short staff) and Bokken (a wooden practice sword in the shape of a Katana). </p>
